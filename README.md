# Facial-and-emotion-recognition
We've developed a comprehensive facial analysis system by combining OpenCV and TensorFlow. OpenCV efficiently captures faces, and TensorFlow is employed for emotion recognition, enabling real-time performance. This system is well-suited for applications in human-computer interaction and intelligent surveillance, offering a reliable solution.
